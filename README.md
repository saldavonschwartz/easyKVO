easyKVO
=======

Category over NSObject that provides automatic removal of KVO observers and broadcasters when objects go out of scope
as well as KVO-triggered callbacks for observers.

This is still work in progress (as in, there are a couple bugs that I am aware of and will try to fix as soon as I can.)
